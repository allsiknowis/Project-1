## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The Anaconda distribution of Python should be the only necessary thing required to run the code here. It should run without issues when using Python 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey to look at the data regarding:

1. What proportion of respondents work from home most of the time?
2. What proportion of respondents like their jobs?
3. What proportion of respondents think they are well paid?
4. What proportion of respondents that mostly work from home like their jobs?
5. What proportion of respondents that mostly work from home and like their jobs feel well paid?

Udacity owns the full set of files related to this project, so I have not made them publicly available here, but parts of the analysis regarding this data can be viewed in the project.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one notebook available here that logically shows the work related to the questions I set out to answer. Markdown cells were used to indicate the reason for the code that follows.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

My findings as a result of the code can be found at the Medium post [here](https://steveellingson.medium.com/happy-with-home-work-bf0e42d02ff3).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data for the project came from Stack. Licensing for the data and other information can be found at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
